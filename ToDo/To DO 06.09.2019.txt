[x]consumergroups for kafka
--> first implementation is working
[x]add commandline parameter parsing
[x]generate messages with random values instead of binary zeros
[x]RabbitMQ Cluster
--> currently a shellscript is necessary to bind the containers to a cluster
[x]remove json marshall from the time measurement
[x]calculate round trip time with send+receive+send+receive time
[x]Zeitmessung bei Kafka ebenfalls komisch
[x]ConsumerProducer process for Rabbit
[x]integrate linkedIn avro library
[x]integrate google protobuf library
[x]measure encoding and decoding time

Findings
- RabbitMQ:
- consume method executed in for loop,
1/3 more timeconsumtion (Kafka ???)
--> possible explanation: with the loop, everytime a neu connection for consuming one message is established
--> without the loop one consume channel is only once created and used for every message 
(saves time because the consume  channel is not needed to recreate for every message)
--> in case of kafka the consume method needs to be in a loop, otherwise the same message is consumesd all the time
